Angular TensorFlow Webcam Face Detection
This project demonstrates real-time face detection using TensorFlow.js in an Angular environment. It utilizes a webcam to capture video input and employs TensorFlow's pre-trained models for face detection.

Prerequisites
Angular CLI should be globally installed (npm install -g @angular/cli).

ng serve
Open your browser and go to http://localhost:4200/ to view the application.

Allow access to your webcam when prompted by the browser.

The webcam feed will start, and the application will perform real-time face detection using TensorFlow.js.
